JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing 
claims to be transferred between two parties. It is used to securely transmit 
information between parties in a JSON format. JWTs can be used to authorize access 
to resources and services.



JWTs are typically used in web applications and APIs to authenticate users and validate their permissions. 
When a user logs in, they are given a JWT which they can then use to make authenticated requests to the API.
 The JWT will contain information about the user, such as their name and ID.
